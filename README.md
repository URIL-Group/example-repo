# Example REPO #
> URIL example repository to be used for practicing git/github skills. 

This file is called `README.md`. A README file is generally used as
the introduction to a repository or source code. It is written in markdown
format which is automatically processed on github into html for display.

*Markdown is awesome for [other reasons](https://plain-text.co/) which
I will not get into here.*

Github and `git` are incredibly useful, especially for software
projects. It is a good idea to be using both. Here is a [good
resource](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/collaboration/lesson/) for learning more.

For members of the lab who wish to use github for collaboration, this
repo can be used as a place to learn and test features.
